## English: CareerMate—Your AI-Powered Job Companion

a. Context:
The number of final-year students who have already completed internships and are preparing for graduation has been increasing rapidly. These students are under pressure to improve their CVs, practice job interviews, and find suitable entry-level jobs.
Currently, they rely on scattered sources such as job boards, social networks, or university career centers. This creates inefficiency and a gap between their skills and employers’ requirements.
Therefore, there is a demand for a platform that leverages AI to support their career readiness: CV analysis, skill-gap detection, personalized career roadmaps, mock interviews, and AI-based job matching with recruiters.

● Provide a Career Coach Chatbot for career consultation, skill recommendations, and mock interviews.
● Develop a jobs marketplace where recruiters post job descriptions, and candidates apply.
● Provide a Learning Hub including curated courses and roadmaps.
● Implement gamification & mentorship features: badges, leaderboards, and challenges.
● Enable Admin Web System to monitor the entire platform, manage users, jobs, and generate analytics.
